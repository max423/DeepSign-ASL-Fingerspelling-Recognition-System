# DeepSign
ASL orthography is a part of American Sign Language (ASL) used to represent and communicate the spelling of words. In ASL spelling, each letter of the alphabet is represented by a specific hand sign.
People use ASL speeling to communicate and understand specific words, proper names or technical terms that may not have a dedicated ASL sign.
We studied how neural networks can learn and recognize ASL. Several solutions have been explored; the whole process is described in the documentation.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our neural network for hand recognition in American Sign Language (ASL), we developed a simple application using the Python programming language. This application harnesses the power of MediaPipe for real-time hand detection and tracking using the device's webcam.
